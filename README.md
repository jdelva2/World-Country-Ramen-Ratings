## Japan Average Rating Value Count Percentage 
  Using Pandas groupby and count function, we can count the total values for each brand rating. We can see that Nissin makes up 65% (32 ratings) compare to Seven Eleven (1 rating).
  This means there was only 1 really good rating for Seven Eleven but Nissin has 32 ratings and is 2nd highest. In a business setting where a shop owner wants to sell the most popular cup ramen. Although it may be tempting to sell Seven Eleven ramen, they might want to choose to sell Nissin since more people tend to rate that the highest. A bigger sample size is a great contribution for this decision making.
